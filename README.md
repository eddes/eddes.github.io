# Data interpolation

In this section, we will use the solar spectrum data provided by the NREL called [ASTM AM 1.5](https://www.nrel.gov/grid/solar-resource/spectra-am1.5.html) an corresponding to ground level solar radiation, including absorption of radiation by gases in the atmosphere.

You can [get the data](https://github.com/eddes/eddes.github.io/blob/main/ASTMed.xls) in .xls file format and the [code here](https://github.com/eddes/eddes.github.io/blob/main/interpolate_ASTM.py)
